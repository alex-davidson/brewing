# Brewing Equipment

* Up: [Home](README.md)

## The Absolute Basics

* A 5 litre (~1 gallon) glass demijohn.
* A rubber bung with an airlock.
* A funnel (absolutely critical, trust me on this).
* Sodium Percarbonate no-rinse cleaner.
* A siphon with racking cane.
* A longhandled plastic spoon.
* Nine or ten 500mL screw-top bottles.

You can get the whole lot for <£20 and probably most of the [ingredients](Ingredients.md) too.

Strictly speaking, you can get away without several of the above, but the job will be much more awkward:
* A bucket works as a brewing container and will probably be easier to clean, but keeping the contents suitably protected might be harder.
  * Proper brewing buckets have an airlock fitting, etc in the lid to solve this problem.
* If you're using a demijohn or other narrow-necked container, you can use cotton wool instead of a bung and airlock, but you need to rack it and bottle it as soon as it finishes fermenting. An airlock means you can basically let it sit for a week or two more without worrying, and it's much less likely to get contaminated while fermenting.
* You can use boiling water to sanitise things instead of Percarbonate, but I don't recommend using it on your hands.
* A long screwdriver can be used instead of a spoon handle for stirring, if you clean and sanitise it properly and take care not to damage the insides of your demijohn.
* You don't really _need_ a racking cane (a simple hose will do) but it's a lot easier to keep the sediment out of the siphon if you use one.

Beware the screw-tops. If the contents are still fermenting, screw-top bottles will eventually release the pressure by exploding, so either kill the yeast thoroughly before bottling, or use crown-caps instead (see below).

## Quality of Life Improvements

* A second container/demijohn. It is much easier to bottle your brew without sediment if you can transfer it to a new clean container beforehand.
* A [bottling wand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Home-Brew-Online-Bottling-Bottler/dp/B01MEGKYS2). Basically a tube with a push-to-open valve at the end. Makes bottling considerably quicker and less messy, and also reduces the amount of air which comes into contact with your alcohol.
* For cider or beer, crown-cap bottles and a decent bottle-capper/corker.
  * Any crown-cap bottle can be reused if thoroughly cleaned first, a [crown-capper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bottle-Crown-Capper-Sealing-Bottles/dp/B0021UVZXS) costs <£20, and crown caps cost a few pennies each. The contents will stay good far longer in a decent glass bottle than a plastic one, and a crown-cap bottle is less likely to explode than a screw-top. Note: DO NOT get a hammer-capper! The lever ones are safer and easier.
* For mead or wine, consider a decent lever-based corker and some good corks. Crappy corks can ruin a good batch of mead or wine.
  * You'll probably find [plastic caps with corks on them](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Home-Brew-Online-Plastic-Stoppers/dp/B016IRBC9Q) in Wilko. They're OK for maybe a few weeks and I use them for capping a 'taster' bottle, but ideally you'll want to aim for something like [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Quality-Wine-Corks-100/dp/B00LEQ8ZMO).
* A *good* airlock. [These things](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002KCXV8E) make far less noise than the typical S-shaped ones which go *GLOP* *GLOPPY* *GLOP* all the time, and they're much easier to clean.
* A [piston-based bottle washer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bottle-Rinser-Cleaner-Cordial-Bottles/dp/B00B6GH5P0) reduces bottling time and aggravation considerably, even more so when paired with a [bottle tree](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Brewcraft-HOZQ8-1157-Bottle-Tree-45/dp/B00BWSSEDY).
* A hydrometer may be useful if you want to measure the alcohol content of your brew. It is used to measure the density of the liquid, before and after fermentation, and the change in density can be used to determine the final alcohol content.
  * Somewhat difficult to use in a narrow-necked vessel like a demijohn, so I generally only use this for large batches (below).

## Scaling Up

* For large batches, something like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002KB1SE4) works well.
  * I consider glass containers rather too heavy for big batches. You'll need to rack the contents into another container at some stage, and then elevate that container in order to bottle from it, so expect to move a full one at least a metre vertically at some stage.
  * The wide neck of the barrel makes it relatively easy to use a hydrometer in it.
  * You'll also want a tub of petroleum jelly for the O-ring in the lid.
* An [auto-siphon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Improved-Design-Litre-Auto-Syphon/dp/B01FY1HKZ2) is strongly recommended for large batches. The neck of a typical demijohn may be too small to accept an auto-siphon but dealing with a large barrel will be immeasurably easier if you don't need to manually prime the siphon.
* You will absolutely want a bottling wand (above) if you're filling 50+ bottles.
