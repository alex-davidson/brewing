# Brewing

This is a repository of my brewing experiments and experiences. I do not guarantee the accuracy of anything here and any attempt to apply this information is made at your own risk, but it WorkedForMe(TM) (except where noted).

* [Ingredients](Ingredients.md)
* [Equipment](Equipment.md)
* [Process](Process.md)

## Recipes

All of these are based on the above process. The instructions are mostly just an aid to memory for me.

* [My Standard Bulk Cider](Cider/BulkCider.md)
* [Treacle Cider](Cider/TreacleCider.md)

* [Maple and Ginger Mead](Mead/MapleMead.md) (experimental)
* [Spiced Mead](Mead/SpicedMead.md) (experimental)

## Logs

* [Mead batches](Mead/Log.md)
* [Cider batches](Cider/Log.md)

## General Notes

* Brewing cider and mead is really really easy.
  * Bottling is really boring though.
* Adding lots of honey to something forgives a multitude of sins.
