# My Standard Bulk Cider (28L)

## Ingredients

* 24L apple juice
* 3L sweet apple juice
* 1 jar (~350g) blackstrap molasses
* 8 plain teabags
* Yeast (wine or cider)
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Make about half a litre of tea in a 1L container.
2. Slowly pour the molasses into the tea, stirring constantly to help it melt.
3. Add yeast nutrient and stir that in too.
4. Prepare the yeast in a cup: half fill with lukewarm water, add a pinch of yeast nutrient, and sprinkle in the yeast.
5. Pour 12L of juice into the fermenter.
6. Pour in the tea/molasses/nutrient mix. Stir.
7. Pour the other 12L of juice into the fermenter.
8. Add the yeast and stir thoroughly.
9. Install the airlock.

Fermentation usually completes within 2 weeks.

## Sweetening

After stabilising, rack into a slightly larger container if necessary. Ensure that the yeast is thoroughly inactivated; this might require a slightly higher dose of Campden, or a second treatment.

1. Add the sweet apple juice and stir it in.
2. Add the finings and stir that in.
3. Airlock it again and avoid moving the barrel.

After two or three weeks, it can be racked a final time and then bottled.

## Notes

* The juice used for fermentation is supermarket 'pure apple juice', usually from concentrate.
* The juice used for sweetening is supermarket juice too, but typically a sweeter one which is not from concentrate.
* The molasses helps to make up for the lack of flavour in the juice.
