[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Make about half a litre of tea in a 1L container.
2. Slowly pour the molasses into the tea, stirring constantly to help it melt.
3. Add yeast nutrient and stir that in too.
4. Prepare the yeast in a cup: half fill with lukewarm water, add a pinch of yeast nutrient, and sprinkle in the yeast.
5. Pour about 2L of juice into the demijohn.
6. Pour in the tea/molasses/nutrient mix.
7. Fill the demijohn up to the shoulder with the rest of the juice.
8. Add the yeast and stir thoroughly.
9. Install the airlock.

Fermentation usually completes within 2 weeks, but multiple rackings and finings will likely be necessary to get all the fluff out.
