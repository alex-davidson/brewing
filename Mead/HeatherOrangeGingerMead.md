# English Heather honey, Orange and Ginger Mead (5L)

_Experimental:_ 2018/12/02

## Ingredients

* ~1.3kg English Heather honey (has a very strong flavour)
* 25g ginger, grated (weight was measured before peeling)
* One orange, cut into eight segments
* ~3 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.
   * Getting the honey into the demijohn will involve a fair amount of hot water, reducing the amount
     of mineral water required.

## Racking

The first racking was easy enough, as the orange and ginger had formed a thick mat of fermenting debris on top of the brew and so the siphon did not get clogged.

The brew was fizzy, quite fiery, and had an extremely strong heather honey flavour. Fermentation still underway. It will also need topping up with mineral water.

Getting the orange slices out of the demijohn involved a fork and ten minutes of swearing.
