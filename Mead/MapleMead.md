# Maple and Ginger Mead (5L)

_Experimental:_ 2018/11/10

Not really a mead since it contains no honey...

## Ingredients

* ~1.6kg pure maple syrup
* 25g ginger, grated (weight was measured before peeling)
* ~3 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

## Racking

The first racking was performed three weeks into fermentation, when it had slowed down considerably. The ginger kept clogging the siphon, so eventually I tipped it through a sieve and a funnel instead to get the ginger out.

At three weeks, the flavour was obscured by the ginger's fire and the syrup was not evident. Very fizzy due to the continuing yeast activity.

The second racking was performed about a week and a half after that, when the airlock was almost inert. Small bubbles could still be observed in the liquid and the pieces of ginger missed the first time around were occasionally rising to the surface. A lot of sediment had come out and the liquid was beginning to show signs of clearing.

At four and a half weeks, the syrup can be tasted and the ginger has subsided. It is very slightly sweet, but mostly fizzy.

After the second racking, potassium sorbate was added.
