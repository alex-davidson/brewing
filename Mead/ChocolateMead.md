# Chocolate Mead (5L)

Recipe here: https://www.washingtonwinemaker.com/blog/2008/03/25/lord-rhys-chocolate-mead-recipe/

## Ingredients

* ~1.3kg honey
* ~100g Cadbury's Bourneville cocoa powder
* ~3 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Sieve the cocoa powder.
1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

I recommend mixing up a 'thick hot chocolate' before trying to get cocoa powder to go into a demijohn.

## Racking

The first racking was performed after a year, when it had been sitting on the lees for a LONG LONG TIME. This is according to the recipe.

As expected, it tasted absolutely vile at this stage. Definite chocolate aroma though.

One year after first racking, it still tastes somewhat sour. Some solids have precipitated on the bottom of the demijohn. Liquid is chocolate brown and almost opaque.

One year and nine months after first racking, it's a bit nasty. I think the small batch might've gone bad. Added bentonite to try to remove some of the solids, to see if that helps.

The large barrel seems to be clearing on its own, albeit slowly.
