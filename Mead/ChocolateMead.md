# Chocolate Mead (5L)

Recipe here: https://www.washingtonwinemaker.com/blog/2008/03/25/lord-rhys-chocolate-mead-recipe/

## Ingredients

* ~1.3kg honey
* ~100g Cadbury's Bourneville cocoa powder
* ~3 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Sieve the cocoa powder.
1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

I recommend mixing up a 'thick hot chocolate' before trying to get cocoa powder to go into a demijohn.

## Racking

The first racking was performed after a year, when it had been sitting on the lees for a LONG LONG TIME. This is according to the recipe.

As expected, it tasted absolutely vile at this stage. Definite chocolate aroma though.

One year after first racking, it still tastes somewhat sour. Some solids have precipitated on the bottom of the demijohn. Liquid is chocolate brown and almost opaque.

One year and nine months after first racking, it's a bit nasty. I think the small batch might've gone bad. Added bentonite to try to remove some of the solids, to see if that helps.

The large barrel seems to be clearing on its own, albeit slowly.

Four months after fining, about a centimetre of sediment has collected at the bottom. The liquid is still not transparent, but definitely lighter and less murky. Racked and tasted: still slightly sour/bitter, but drinkable and clearly improving. Decided to mature it further in bottles.

Note: the decision to mature in bottles was made after a spot of mould was found in the airlock. I'm not sure if the brew was contaminated, but if not then it'll be safer in an airtight bottle.

Around eight months after first racking, the large barrel was backsweetened and fined with bentonite. When I racked it again about a month later it was not really drinkable yet but clearly improving much faster than the small batch. Fining has taken out a lot of the nastier flavours without affecting the chocolate, it seems.

Large barrel backsweetened again. More solids have precipitated out, probably due to winter temperatures in our kitchen. Still not quite ready to bottle; maybe another 6 months and some more sweetening?
In future, large batches need to start with three tubs of honey rather than two.

2024/04/26: Siphoned four bottles off the large barrel for taste testing. The liquid is clear brown, with no visible sediment or cloudiness. Sweetening worked wonders: tastes pretty good to me. Will gather opinions tomorrow on whether it needs more honey.

2024/04/28: Two bottles tasted, one gifted. Bottled the remainder. Total: 39 bottles.
