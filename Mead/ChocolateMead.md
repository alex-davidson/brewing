# Chocolate Mead (5L)

Recipe here: https://www.washingtonwinemaker.com/blog/2008/03/25/lord-rhys-chocolate-mead-recipe/

## Ingredients

* ~1.3kg honey
* ~100g Cadbury's Bourneville cocoa powder
* ~3 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Sieve the cocoa powder.
1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

I recommend mixing up a 'thick hot chocolate' before trying to get cocoa powder to go into a demijohn.

## Racking

The first racking was performed after a year, when it had been sitting on the lees for a LONG LONG TIME. This is according to the recipe.

As expected, it tasted absolutely vile at this stage. Definite chocolate aroma though.
