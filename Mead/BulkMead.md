# My Standard Bulk Mead (28L)

## Ingredients

* ~10kg honey
* two lemons, each cut into eight segments
* 12 litres apple juice
* ~12 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

I'm currently trying it with about 25g of grated ginger too.

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Put all the stuff in a large fermenter, stir it, airlock it.

## Notes

I first made this with ~30 jars of Sainsburys Basics honey. That had an original gravity of about 1.110 and ended up around 1.040, or ~10% ABV according to my cheap multi-scale hydrometer.

I'm writing this page having tried it again with 3x 3.3kg tubs of Payne's blossom honey instead. The OG was at the very limit of the hydrometer's scale: about 1.150. The final gravity was 1.055, putting it in the region of 13% ABV.

Next time I'll stick to just two tubs...

## Racking

The ginger blocked the auto-siphon, which is somewhat fussier about these things than a regular racking cane since the pump mechanism will let in air once it's drained, leading to air bubbling through the destination container.

I ended up using the sieve approach again for the last 20% or so. Fortunately the shape of the fermenter meant that draining off the mead was possible without getting too much of the sludge at the bottom.
