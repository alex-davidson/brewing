# Spiced Mead (5L)

_Experimental:_ 2018/12/03

## Ingredients

* ~2kg honey
* 1 cinnamon stick, broken into four pieces
* ~2g cardamom pods (13 pods)
* 50g ginger, grated (weight was measured before peeling)
* 1 lemon, cut into 8 pieces
* 3 large pinches of mixed peppercorns
* ~2.7 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

## Racking

As with the Maple mead, the first racking was performed at three weeks and involved a sieve.

This may have been too early. Airlock activity hadn't stopped (though had decreased a lot) but I wanted to get the stronger spices out before they took over the brew.

The mead was sweet and fruity at this stage. There were no overpowering flavours.

Next time: I'll leave it another couple of weeks, or use more spices.
