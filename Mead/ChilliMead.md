# Chilli Mead (5L)

_Experimental:_ 2019/03/02

## Ingredients

* ~1.4kg honey
* 3 hot chillis (Bird's Eye?)
* Large handful of mint
* ~3 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Cut the chillis lengthways and scrape out the seeds.
1. Remove stems from the mint, leaving just leaves.
1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

## Warning

Capsaicin and sodium percarbonate develop some analogue of mustard gas when combined. Washing up after preparing this stuff can be hazardous.

## Result

Reached a very drinkable state in only 5 months. The flavour of the chillis is strong and there's a slight bite in the aftertaste. The mint was probably a waste of time.
