# Road to Ruin Mead (5L)

## Ingredients

Initial batch consisted of two demijohns, doubling the below.

* ~1.3kg honey
* 2 tbsp 'Road to Ruin 2022' honey, donated by friends who attended Apocalypticus
* ~2.5 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

## Racking

The intent is to backsweeten this mead using some more of the R2R honey. As my meads tend to be on the sweeter side anyway, this may or may not turn out to be a good idea.

During the second racking, I found a white growth (flaky, not furry) inside one of the airlocks. The affected demijohn tasted drier than the pristine one; I suspect it's contaminated.

I'm not certain the pristine demijohn necessarily needs backsweetening, but I plan to add another tablespoon of R2R honey to it prior to bottling to strengthen the flavour in that direction.
