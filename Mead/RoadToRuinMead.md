# Road to Ruin Mead (5L)

## Ingredients

Initial batch consisted of two demijohns, doubling the below.

* ~1.3kg honey
* 2 tbsp 'Road to Ruin 2022' honey, donated by friends who attended Apocalypticus
* ~2.5 litres mineral water
* Wine yeast
* Yeast nutrient

## Preparation

[Basic Process](../Process.md)

1. Put all the stuff in a demijohn, stir it, airlock it.

## Racking

The intent is to backsweeten this mead using some more of the R2R honey. As my meads tend to be on the sweeter side anyway, this may or may not turn out to be a good idea.
